# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MacWSBootingGuide is a WIP jailbreak project that enables running macOS's WindowServer (and macOS GUI applications) on jailbroken iOS/iPadOS devices (arm64, Dopamine rootless jailbreak). It works by chrooting into a bind-mounted macOS filesystem and using dyld interpositioning to patch incompatible system calls and framework behaviors at runtime.

## Patch Discipline (load-bearing rule — read first)

This codebase has burned multiple sessions on patches that LOOK fixed because
the immediate crash stopped but actually leave the underlying invariant
broken, then cascade into worse failures. Don't do this.

**A symptom-suppressing patch is NOT a fix.** If your change is one of:

- `bl <thing> → nop` (the thing was supposed to run; NOPing it skips setup
  that downstream code assumes ran)
- `b.{eq,ne,hi,hs} → b` (forcing a path the original wouldn't take; the
  unforced path's preconditions still apply to what runs after)
- Hooking a check function (`validateBufferTextureWithSize:`,
  `someInternalThing` etc.) to always return 1 / YES / non-nil
- Blanket-bypassing `__assert_rtn`, `abort_with_payload`, `objc_release`,
  any class-wide method override returning a constant
- "If nil, calloc a zero buffer and return that as a stub"
- Filling `Device->X` / `this->Y` with a zero blob "so the deref doesn't
  crash"
- An env-gated `if (getenv("MACWS_X")) skip_check();` for an actual
  protocol check, not just a diagnostic toggle

then call it a **diagnostic** or **temporary scaffold**, **not** a fix.
Either keep going to find the root cause, or label it explicitly so the
next reader knows it's a marker that something is still broken.

**The right layer is upstream.** If a buffer field is nil where it
shouldn't be, the question is "what was supposed to fill it" — and then
"why didn't that fill succeed". Walking down into the crashing function
and NOPing past the deref is working at the wrong layer.

**Process uptime ≠ stability.** A process whose `__assert_rtn` is
globally bypassed can stay alive while quietly leaking state every frame.
Witnesses for stability are: visible output (VNC pixels, completed XPC
round-trips), counters advancing, frames landing. Not `etime`.

**Existing band-aids that exemplify what NOT to repeat:**

| Patch (was/is in tree) | Why it was wrong | Real fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Mempool::grow b.hs → b` NOP (commit `4124628`, rolled back by `098690e`) | Skipped freelist init; downstream `newBuffer` read uninit storage and crashed worse | `MACWS_AGX_REGISTER_CLASSES=1` walks `__objc_classlist`+`objc_readClassPair` so `objc_alloc(AGXBuffer)` actually works → lambda fills the chunks legitimately |
| `findOrCreate<X>ProgramVariant` stub-prologue 5-insn `movz/movk*3/ret 0x1000-byte calloc` (whack-a-mole, removed by `247da92`) | Every new variant lookup was its own null deref | NSBundle registration via `bundleWithPath:` + `loadAndReturnError:` so `setupCompiler:`'s `pathForResource:ds.g13g` resolves → `Device->0x318` (AGX::Compiler*) is real → ALL variant lookups succeed naturally |
| Blanket `__assert_rtn → log+return` (still in tree, **lazy**) | Masks `_state_stack.empty() "Unbalanced Composites"` at MetalContext.mm:411 → SkyLight composite state stack leaks every frame | Find why intermediate composite ops early-return (currently ResCreate FAIL inside AGXIOC) and fix THAT |

See `[[feedback-no-lazy-nop-ret-bypass]]` in agent memory for the
catalogue + the diagnostic technique (`MACWS_AGX_CRASH_DIAG` register +
memory dump in `mac_hooks.m`) that turns these into one-cycle
root-cause solves.

## Evidence Discipline (load-bearing rule — read second)

**Hard rule: every claim about why something is broken must be backed by
either (a) decompiled code from the actual binary involved (otool /
capstone / lldb disasm of the specific function), or (b) a runtime log
line / lldb register dump / crash report excerpt that you copied verbatim
from the running system.**

No hypotheses promoted to fact without one of those two artifacts.
Examples of statements that fail this rule:

- "The kernel rejects because of signature check" — without showing the
  disasm of the rejection point.
- "asyncReference must be non-NULL" — without dumping it from a kernel
  externalMethod breakpoint.
- "iOS sends a different args layout" — without disasming both
  iOS and macOS userland's call sites.

When a claim IS RE-backed, label it: `RE-confirmed via <file>+<offset>`
or `runtime-confirmed via <log/crash filename>`. When it's a guess,
label it THEORY and add what evidence would confirm/refute it.

This rule exists because we've burned multiple sessions chasing theories
that felt obvious but were wrong. Two recent examples that the discipline
caught:

1. "macOS binary lacks signing identity for private GPU operations"
   hypothesis — disproven by capstone disasm of
   `IOGPUDeviceUserClient::externalMethod` at `0xfffffe0009eed344`
   showing the kernel does NOT check signing or entitlement strings in
   that path.

2. Then we hypothesized "the rejection is from a per-user-client
   `device->0x108` size limit that gets zero'd for unprivileged opener".
   Also disproven: `misc/agx_iogpu_probe.c` (iOS-native KRW reader) opened
   an AGXAccelerator UC and walked
   `task_get_ipc_port_kobject → UC+0x120 → IOGPUDevice+0x48 → IOGPU`
   to find `IOGPU+0x108 = 0x139ce0000` (5.13 GB cap) AND that IOGPU is a
   real singleton (same kernel address across multiple matching paths,
   so chroot sees same value). The size check trivially passes. UC+0x103
   = 0 → not the saaramar restricted-method-table mechanism either.
   The actual reject site that returns `0xe00002c2 = kIOReturnNoBandwidth`
   is elsewhere in `IOGPUFamily` and is still being RE'd.

## Project-Knowledge-First & IDA Pro RE Workflow (load-bearing rule — read third)

**Hard rule A — search this project BEFORE inventing solutions.** When a
problem appears, FIRST grep `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/` (especially
`docs/evidence/` and `docs/porting/`), and source-file comments for the
error string / syscall name / subsystem. The original author walked this
same path: version numbers differ (13.4 vs 15.6.1) but the architecture
and failure modes are the same. Most blockers encountered during a port
have already been documented, worked around, or explicitly ruled out —
re-deriving them from scratch burns sessions on already-solved problems.

**Hard rule B — all reverse engineering goes through IDA Pro via the
ida-pro-mcp MCP server.** Do NOT scrape binaries with ad-hoc
`otool | grep | awk` pipelines, `strings`, or Python byte-hunting when a
genuine question exists ("which function calls X", "what does this branch
check", "where does this string get referenced") — that approach is slow,
token-heavy, and produces disconnected fragments. Instead:

1. Identify the exact binary that owns the behavior (e.g.
   `analysis/dyld_15.6.1_arm64e_thin`, a framework from the rootfs, a
   kernel extension).
2. **Tell the user the absolute file path to load** into IDA Pro, and wait
   for them to load it + start the ida-pro-mcp server (default
   `http://127.0.0.1:13337/mcp`, server name `ida-pro-mcp-Instance1`).
3. Then analyze through the MCP tools — `find_regex`/`search_text` for
   strings, `xrefs_to` for references, `decompile` for Hex-Rays output,
   `func_query`/`list_funcs` for navigation, `py_eval` for anything the
   canned tools don't cover. IDA keeps names, xrefs, types and call
   graphs logically connected — use it.
4. For thin slices needed on-device work, pre-extract with
   `lipo -thin arm64e` into `analysis/` so the user gets one file path.

**Hard rule B2 — use IDA Pro MCP (`py_eval`) whenever IDA can answer it;
do not substitute Python.** If the question is about binary contents —
offsets, instruction encodings, xrefs, bytes at an address, struct field
provenance — drive IDA (`py_eval` for `idc`/`ida_*` APIs, `get_bytes`,
`disasm`, `decompile`), not local Python parsing. Hand-rolled Python byte
math has repeatedly produced wrong encodings (e.g. the `udiv`/branch-off
trampoline bugs) and burns tokens on re-verification. Legitimate Python
use is limited to what IDA cannot reach: device-side file I/O over SSH
(copy/pwrite/re-sign a remote binary), rootfs packaging, and byte-level
verification of a deployed device file. Even then, derive the patch
bytes/locations from IDA first.

Rule A applies before Rule B: if the doc tables already answer it, do not
open IDA at all.

**Goal:** Run macOS WindowServer in chroot on jailbroken iPad13,6 (iOS
16.3 arm64) using **real iOS AGX kernel driver only**
(`MACWS_AGX_NATIVE=1`). Verify via VNC screen capture that **GlassDemo
renders fully** — title bar, controls, AND **blur**
(`NSVisualEffectView` vibrancy / backdrop blur) — none of which work
fully under the MTLSim path.

### Why NOT the SIM path

Confirmed gaps (memory: `backdrop-blur-tile-pipeline-blocked`):

- MTLSimDriver's `newRenderPipelineStateWithTileDescriptor` is a
  `MTLReportFailure` stub → tile pipelines unavailable.
- QuartzCore's `BlurState::tile_downsample` returns no output →
  NSVisualEffectView vibrancy renders pure black.
- Complex GPU-heavy apps (Firefox WebRender / Chrome) hit the same
  modern-Metal-feature gaps and can't render.

### What works under AGX-native today (runtime-confirmed)

- Cross-image ObjC class preregistration (`_dyld_image_count` walk +
  `objc_readClassPair` per image with `__objc_classlist`) — AGXBuffer
  + 51 other AGXMetal13_3 classes register. Log:
  `PREREGISTER image[308] AGXMetal13_3: 52/52 realized`.
- `-[AGXG13GFamilyDevice setupCompiler:]` runs to completion. Log:
  `MACWS_AGX_NATIVE setupCompiler:0x30010 fired (Device=…)`.
- `setupDeferred` dispatch_once block reaches `Mempool::grow` and
  iterates the lambda 6+ times per session without crashing.
- 4-arg `-[IOGPUMetalResource initWithDevice:options:args:argsSize:]`
  swizzle catches the BL site lldb-traced inside
  `AGX::Heap<true>::allocateImpl` block_invoke at `0x1e5a4d628`.
- `macwsallocd` (iOS-native launchd daemon,
  `com.macwsguide.alloc`) allocates 256 MB IOSurfaces and ships
  mach-ports to chroot. ~10-15 IOSurface round-trips per WS start.
- Synthesized AGXG13GFamilyBuffer via bare-alloc + associated-object
  tagging + class-wide swizzles on `-resourceSize` / `-length` /
  `-contents` / `-virtualAddress` / `-gpuAddress` / `-device` returns
  the IOSurface-derived values when tagged.
- `ivar+0x30 = calloc(16K)` per buf satisfies Mempool::grow's
  freelist init without libmalloc heap corruption (using IOSurface
  base there triggers `free_list_checksum_botch` on dealloc — RE +
  runtime confirmed).
- AGXIOC sels 0x0, 0x2, 0x4, 0x5, 0x21, 0x25, 0x100, 0x102, 0x107 all
  succeed against the chroot's user-client (these are read/query/info
  methods — they don't need the privileged init state).

### Structural blockers (RE-confirmed, NOT theories)

| # | Failing op | RE evidence | Root cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `IOConnectCallMethod sel=0xa→0x9` (heap create) | kernel returns `0xe00002c2 = kIOReturnNoBandwidth`. The two reject sites inside `IOGPUDevice::new_resource` (`+0x44` checking `(IOGPU+0x224)+0x50 vs *outCnt`, and `+0xff` checking `args+0x40 vs (3*IOGPU+0x108/4)`) BOTH pass for our calls: `misc/agx_iogpu_probe` runtime measured `IOGPU+0x108 = 0x139ce0000` (5.13 GB) and `IOGPU+0x224 = 0` against the singleton at `0xfffffe690002c000` (same kernel object for chroot and iOS-native). | **Reject site is elsewhere in `IOGPUFamily`** — RE in progress to find which path returns 0xe00002c2 (candidates: per-task wire/pin limit, IOMemoryDescriptor::prepare on the backing memory, or a higher-up dispatch check). `MACWS_AGXIOC_FUZZ=1` confirms NO args-shape perturbation succeeds → the gate doesn't look at args at all. |
| 2 | `IOConnectCallMethod sel=0x7→0x6` / `sel=0x8→0x7` (queue create) | `inSC=1032` hex dump captured via libmachook `IOConnectCallMethod_new` one-shot dumper. macOS userland packs process path string at offset 0; iOS-native `_IOGPUCommandQueueCreateWithQoS+0xaf0` (otool disasm of `~/Downloads/agx-re/ios/IOGPU`) zeros the buffer then writes QoS at `+0x400` / priority at `+0x404`. Patched IOConnect translator to substitute iOS-shape buffer → kernel STILL returns `0xe00002c2`. | Same UC-init root cause as #1. |
| 3 | Borrow io_connect_t from iOS-native helper via XPC | Standalone borrow test runtime log (no chroot WS in loop): macwsallocd opens UC OK → `set_mach_send completed` → `about to send_message` → SIGKILL'd. Crash report `EXC_GUARD ILLEGAL_MOVE on mach port`. | `io_connect_t` mach ports are first-class GUARDED by IOKit at the kernel-port level. `mach_msg` transfer of the send-right trips the kernel guard. **Structural — the user-client port cannot cross task boundaries.** |
| 4 | SkyLight compositor needs non-nil queue | `CAWSBackend.mm:5130 — Assertion failed: (compositor != nullptr)`. BT chain via lldb: `setupDeferred → newCommandQueue` (queue alloc'd via sel=0x7/0x8 which return nil). | Downstream of #2. |
| 5 | Compositor missing means no rendering | VNC framebuffer all-zero PNG (`md5` confirmed identical across multiple grabs from `vncdo capture`); chroot `screencapture -x` also all-zero. WS process can stay alive (no crash log) but produces no display output. | Downstream of #4. |

### What this rules out (saved from repeating)

| Approach | Status | Why ruled out |
|---|---|---|
| Add more entitlements | ❌ Disproved | backboardd (works) has only 2 GPU-private entitlements: `allow-explicit-graphics-priority`, `graphics-restart-no-kill`. Our `entitlements.plist` already has both. |
| Re-sign binary with iOS team-id | ❌ Disproved by RE | `IOGPUDeviceUserClient::externalMethod` at `0xfffffe0009eed344` (capstone) has no entitlement-string check or task-credential check in the dispatch path. |
| `IOServiceOpen` type variations | ❌ Disproved | Tested `type=0`, `type=2`, `type=1` (mask of `0x100001`), and `0x100001` raw — all give same broken UC. `MACWS_AGX_FORCE_TYPE` env var exists for further fuzzing. |
| `IOConnectCallMethod` args shape patch | ❌ Disproved | `MACWS_AGXIOC_FUZZ=1` perturbed every reachable byte; all 10 perturbations fail same code. |
| Borrow opened io_connect_t from helper | ❌ Disproved this session | EXC_GUARD ILLEGAL_MOVE; see blocker #3. |
| Synth buffer via `pinnedGPULocation:` in chroot | ❌ Disproved | `pinnedGPULocation:` also routes through sel=0xa internally → same kernel rejection. Verified: pin5 call hangs the chroot thread. |

### Only remaining viable path (NOT implemented; substantial work)

**Full Metal proxy**: chroot serializes every `MTL*` operation
(`setBuffer/setTexture/setRenderPipelineState/draw…/blit*/commit`) →
XPC to a new helper running in iOS-native context (sees real AGX) →
helper replays on a real iOS `MTLCommandQueue` → returns IOSurfaces
back.

Open architectural risks (must be considered before committing):

- **Performance** — typical SkyLight frame = 500-2000 encoder calls.
  At ~10-50 µs/XPC roundtrip, 60 fps budget (16.7 ms) is overrun 1-4×.
  Static scenes likely OK; interactive/scrolling not.
- **`MTLDrawable` / `CAMetalLayer` cross-process** — display
  submission may not be proxyable; if not, no on-screen pixels.
- **`MTLLibrary` / pipeline state per-device binding** — chroot-built
  libraries won't directly run in helper's device; may require
  AIR-source re-ship + re-compile, slow.
- The architecture is **NOT** strictly "AGX native from chroot" —
  chroot itself never directly touches AGX. It's an iOS-native AGX
  execution bridge. Same shape as MTLSim path, just with a self-built
  proxy instead of Apple's MTLSim.

### Recovery: one-click stop of all chroot services

When CPU/load gets stuck due to a crash loop, build-helper zombies, or
orphan debug tools, **don't keep restarting WS** — that just keeps the
loop alive. Run the project's recovery script:

```bash
sudo bash /var/jb/var/mobile/MacWSBootingGuide/misc/cleanup_all.sh
```

It stops the GUI stack, unloads all `com.macwsguide.*` launchd jobs,
kills WindowServer / launchservicesd / OSXvnc-server / macwsallocd /
autosignd / launchdchrootexec / orphan oslog / tail / find_crash from
debug sessions, then prints the final state. Bounds damage from a
runaway loop to ~10 seconds of high CPU.

## Session-State Recovery (do this FIRST after context loss)

If the conversation was summarized/interrupted, **read
`docs/porting/dyld-15.6.1-state.md` before doing anything else.** It holds
the live patch ledger, fat-offset rules, confirmed root causes, bisect
results, and next steps for the macOS 15.6.1 dyld shared-cache bring-up.
Keep that file updated as ground truth; do not re-derive state from
scratch.

Also read `docs/porting/TOOLS-AND-PORTING.md` — the inventory of the
project's built-in tools (what `sprobe`, `launchdchrootexec`, `libmachook`,
the `lldb_*` scripts, `loadtc`, `extract_dyld_cache.py` etc. are FOR) and
the proven procedure for porting a new macOS version rootfs onto the iPad.
The toolchain already exists — reuse it, don't reinvent it.

## Hard rules for reverse engineering

**Use IDA Pro whenever possible — prefer the ida-pro-mcp server
(`py_eval`) for ALL binary analysis. Python-based byte-poking is wrong,
wastes tokens, and has repeatedly produced bad encodings.** Only use
shell/python for what IDA can't reach (device-side file I/O over SSH,
deploying/signing/verifying a patched file, running tests). Derive every
patch's bytes/offsets from IDA first.

## Device Access (hardcoded — do not re-derive)

- **SSH**: `root@192.168.64.1 -p 2222`, password `cisco`
  (use `sshpass -p cisco`; no SSH keys on this Mac — `~/.ssh` is empty).
  The device IP has changed before (`192.168.5.8`, `172.20.10.3`); if
  `.64.1` is unreachable, scan reachable subnets for an open `2222`.
- **File staging area on device** — upload ALL scripts/debs/patched
  binaries here (old files may be overwritten freely):

  `/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/1B2AD29A-2C34-4770-86EC-E11CD02312FF/File Provider Storage/macPad_iOS`

- The on-device repo `/var/jb/var/mobile/MacWSBootingGuide` and
  `/var/jb/var/mobile/theos` may not exist — the device was re-jailbroken;
  work from the staging dir + `/var/mnt/rootfs` (macOS 15.6.1 mount) and
  `/var/jb/usr/macOS` (installed package).

## Build

This project uses [Theos](https://theos.dev).

### Build on iOS (on-device) via SSH

Theos is installed at `/var/jb/var/mobile/theos`. The project lives at
`/var/jb/var/mobile/MacWSBootingGuide`. SSH does **not** inherit `THEOS` from
the device's interactive shell, so pass it explicitly:

```bash
# From macOS, over SSH (one-liner):
ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.5.8 \
  'THEOS=/var/jb/var/mobile/theos bash /var/jb/var/mobile/MacWSBootingGuide/misc/build_on_ios.sh'
```

`build_on_ios.sh` does: clean → make → package → dpkg install → set macOS
build version → fix arm64e interpose section → re-sign → postinst.

After a successful build, verify with:
```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.5.8 'sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh -c "echo hi"'
# Expected output: "chdir: No such file or directory" (harmless), then "hi", exit 0
```

Git operations over SSH fail due to host-key policy; use `git reset --hard
origin/main` to sync (fetch works with HTTPS, push does not from device).

### Build on iOS (on-device) manually

```bash
# On the device shell with THEOS set:
export THEOS=/var/jb/var/mobile/theos
cd /var/jb/var/mobile/MacWSBootingGuide
make FINALPACKAGE=1 STRIP=0 THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME=rootless GO_EASY_ON_ME=1 package
sudo dpkg -i packages/*.deb

# Required: patch LC_BUILD_VERSION from iOS → macOS 13.0; macOS dyld rejects iOS platform tag
sudo python3 misc/set_macos_version.py /var/jb/usr/macOS/lib/libmachook.dylib

# Required: re-sign after binary was modified above
sudo ldid -S /var/jb/usr/macOS/lib/libmachook.dylib

sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/postinst.sh
```

### Build on macOS (cross-compile)

```bash
gmake FINALPACKAGE=1 STRIP=0 THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME=rootless package install \
  THEOS_DEVICE_IP=<device_ip> THEOS_DEVICE_PORT=2222 GO_EASY_ON_ME=1
```

After install, on the device:
```bash
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/postinst.sh
```

There are no automated tests. Debug with:
```bash
sudo oslog | grep "AMFI\|debugbydcmmc\|launchd\|launchser\|WindowSer\|MTL\|Metal\|Terminal\|iolation"
```

## Architecture

### Subprojects

The root `Makefile` builds six subprojects:

**iOS-side (run in iOS context):**
- `MTLCompilerBypassOSCheck/` — CydiaSubstrate tweak that patches `MTLCompilerService` platform checks so it will compile Metal shaders for a macOS (non-iOS) target.
- `MTLSimDriverHost/` — XPC service that hosts `MTLSimDriver.framework` (from the iOS Simulator runtime). Bridging macOS Metal calls to the iOS GPU driver.
- `launchdchrootexec/` — Small iOS binary that chroots into the macOS rootfs and execs a macOS binary with `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` pointing to `libmachook.dylib`.
- `autosignd/` — iOS-side daemon that signs + trustcaches Mach-O binaries on demand. `libmachook`'s exec hooks ask it (over a unix socket) to ad-hoc re-sign + trustcache each binary just before it is `exec`'d, so arbitrary macOS programs run in the chroot without pre-listing every binary in `postinst.sh`.

**macOS-side (compiled for macOS target, run inside the chroot):**
- `libmachook/` — The core dylib injected into every macOS process. Contains all runtime interposition hooks.
- `launchservicesd/` — Loader that converts the macOS `launchservicesd` daemon into a dylib so it can run without entitlements that would cause a codesign panic.

### libmachook — Core Hook Library

`libmachook/mac_hooks.m` is the primary file. It registers a `dyld_register_func_for_add_image` callback (`loadImageCallback`) that fires for every loaded image and applies binary patches by scanning for specific byte sequences at runtime (hardcoded for iOS 16.5 / macOS 13.4).

Key patches applied:
- **SkyLight** — Removes backboardd coexistence check.
- **IOMobileFramebuffer** — Fixes kernel parameter passing for the iOS framebuffer.
- **Metal** — Bypasses extra MTL reflection deserialization; patches `sysctlbyname` to spoof OS version (reports iOS 16.x as macOS 13.x).
- **libxpc** — Registers `MTLCompilerService` bundle for the XPC lookup.
- **Sandbox** — Disables `sandbox_init_with_parameters` (returns 0).
- **Audit tokens** — Stubs `audit_token_to_asid`, `audit_token_to_auid`, `auditon`, `getaudit_addr` (missing on iOS).
- **Mach ports** — Patches `mach_port_construct` to remove invalid flags.

Additional hook files in `libmachook/`:
- `Metal_hooks.x` — Hooks `MTLSimDevice` and `MTLSimBuffer` to fix storage mode mismatches and `vm_remap`-based XPC memory sharing.
- `QuartzCore_hooks.x` — Skips unsupported tile render pipeline calls.
- `jit.m` — Enables JIT (MAP_JIT) for the process.
- `objc_hooks.c` — ObjC runtime patches.
- `os_log_hooks.m` / `os_variant_hooks.x` — Logging and OS variant spoofing.

### File Syntax

`.x` files use [Logos](https://theos.dev/docs/logos-syntax) (Theos hooking preprocessor). Key directives:
- `%hook ClassName` / `%end` — Hook an Objective-C class.
- `%orig` — Call the original implementation.
- `%ctor` / `%dtor` — Constructor/destructor.

### Hardcoded Offsets

Many patches in `mac_hooks.m` search for hardcoded byte sequences to locate patch sites. These are specific to **iOS 16.5 / macOS 13.4**. When porting to new OS versions, these byte patterns need to be re-derived.

### Entitlements

`entitlements.plist` contains 100+ entitlements required for direct kernel/GPU/hardware access. Every macOS binary run inside the chroot must be re-signed with this plist: `ldid -S./entitlements.plist -M <binary>`.

### Required External Frameworks

Must be sourced from the iOS Simulator runtime (not included in this repo):
- `MTLSimDriver.framework`
- `MTLSimImplementation.framework`
- `MetalSerializer.framework`

### Running Binaries in the macOS Chroot

Before any macOS binary can run on the device, it must be re-signed and its CDHash registered in the trustcache:

```bash
# Re-sign with required entitlements
ldid -S/var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/entitlements.plist -M /var/mnt/rootfs/path/to/binary

# Register CDHash(es) — repeat for each slice you need
cdhash=$(ldid -arch arm64 -h /var/mnt/rootfs/path/to/binary 2>/dev/null | grep CDHash= | cut -c8-)
jbctl trustcache add "$cdhash"
```

Enter the macOS bash environment interactively (CLI only):
```bash
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh
```

Run commands or scripts non-interactively (`run_bash.sh` forwards all arguments to bash):
```bash
# Inline command
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh -c "echo hello"

# Multi-line script piped via stdin (script lives on iOS filesystem)
# Always set the full environment at the top of every script:
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh -s <<'EOF'
# --- standard chroot environment ---
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:\
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin:\

export HOME=/Users/root
export USER=root
export TMPDIR=/tmp

export HTTP_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082
# SSL: Security framework is unreachable in chroot; use the system cert bundle:
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/cert.pem
# --- end environment ---

echo "running in chroot"
port version
python3.13 --version
EOF

# Script file that lives on the macOS rootfs, with arguments
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh /tmp/script.sh arg1 arg2
```

- `chdir: No such file or directory` always appears on stderr — harmless, falls back to `/`.
- PATH is inherited from the iOS shell; **always override it** in scripts or tools will resolve to iOS procursus binaries which crash inside the chroot (libiosexec sandbox).
- `HOME=/Users/root`, `USER=root`, `TMPDIR=/tmp` are pre-set by `launchdchrootexec` but PATH is not.
- `SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/cert.pem` is required for any Python/curl SSL to work — the macOS Security framework (Keychain) is unreachable in the chroot.
- For script files: place them under `/var/mnt/rootfs/` so they are accessible inside the chroot (e.g. iOS path `/var/mnt/rootfs/tmp/script.sh` → chroot path `/tmp/script.sh`).
- After installing software via `port` or `brew`, run `misc/sign_installed.sh` from the iOS shell to sign and trustcache all new Mach-O files (see below).

Start WindowServer and GUI daemons (unloads SpringBoard/backboardd first):
```bash
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.{SpringBoard,backboardd}.plist
sudo launchctl load /var/jb/usr/macOS/LaunchDaemons
```

Inside the chroot shell, run GUI applications:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/OSXvnc-server -rfbnoauth   # start VNC server first
/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal
/System/Applications/Utilities/Activity\ Monitor.app/Contents/MacOS/Activity\ Monitor
```

Return to iOS (respring):
```bash
sudo launchctl unload /var/jb/usr/macOS/LaunchDaemons
sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.{SpringBoard,backboardd}.plist
```

### Device Setup Summary

1. Mount a full macOS filesystem DMG to `/var/mnt/rootfs` with the symlinks described in the README.
2. Patch `dyld`, `launchservicesd`, and `WindowServer` binaries (some manual, some automated by hooks — see README's "Additional patches" section).
3. Run `postinst.sh` to re-sign binaries and register trustcaches via `jbctl trustcache add`.
4. Use `launchdchrootexec` (via launchctl) to start macOS daemons; WindowServer reads display via `IOMobileFramebuffer`.
5. Connect via VNC (`OSXvnc-server`) or interact via the chroot shell.

## Practical Knowledge: iOS Shell Operations

### Commands That Require `sudo`

Run these from the iOS shell (SSH or terminal). Almost all privileged operations need `sudo`:

```bash
# Always need sudo:
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh          # enter chroot
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/postinst.sh          # re-sign & trustcache
sudo ldid -S<entitlements> -M <binary>               # re-sign a binary (writes signature)
sudo jbctl trustcache add <cdhash>                   # register CDHash (modifies trustcache)
sudo /var/jb/usr/local/bin/mount_bindfs <src> <dst>  # bind mount
sudo launchctl load/unload <plist>                   # manage daemons
sudo dmesg                                           # kernel log

# Do NOT need sudo (read-only or user-space):
ldid -h <binary>                  # inspect CDHash (read-only)
ldid -arch arm64 -h <bin> 2>/dev/null | grep CDHash= | cut -c8-  # extract cdhash
jbctl trustcache info             # dump trustcache contents (read-only)
ls, cat, grep, file, strings      # read-only inspection
oslog                             # log streaming (may need sudo for kernel logs)
python3                           # iOS procursus python3
```

**jbctl trustcache commands**:
- `jbctl trustcache add <hash>` — requires sudo (modifies trustcache)
- `jbctl trustcache info` — no sudo needed (read-only, dumps all CDHashes)
- `jbctl trustcache list` — **broken**, always returns empty; use `info` instead

**Non-interactive sudo pattern** (for scripting from macOS via SSH):
```bash
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh -c "command"
```

### Extracting and Registering CDHashes

```bash
# Sign and register a single binary (all architectures):
ENT=/var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/entitlements.plist
sudo ldid -S"$ENT" -M /var/mnt/rootfs/path/to/binary
for arch in arm64 arm64e x86_64; do
    h=$(ldid -arch "$arch" -h /var/mnt/rootfs/path/to/binary 2>/dev/null | grep CDHash= | cut -c8-)
    [ -n "$h" ] && sudo /var/jb/usr/bin/jbctl trustcache add "$h"
done
```

---

## Critical Constraint: AMFI Shebang Block

**AMFI kills `execve()` of any file with a `#!/...` shebang line** (exits 126, `EPERM`).
This applies to ALL scripts, not just shell scripts.

**Symptoms**: Command exits immediately with no output; `dmesg` shows `AMFI: ... deny`.

**Workaround — remove shebangs**: When bash tries to exec a file and gets `ENOEXEC` (no
recognized binary/shebang format), it falls back to interpreting it as a shell script directly.
This works for any script executed within a running bash session.

```bash
# Strip the first line if it's a shebang (iOS-side, using python3 — NOT GNU sed):
python3 -c "
import sys
with open(sys.argv[1], 'r+') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    if lines and lines[0].startswith('#!'):
        f.seek(0); f.writelines(lines[1:]); f.truncate()
" /var/mnt/rootfs/path/to/script
```

**Do NOT use GNU sed** (`/var/jb/usr/bin/sed`) to strip shebangs — it corrupts files due to
`\n`/`\r\n` line-ending differences. Use procursus `python3` on the iOS side instead.

**Applies to**: Any shell script, Python script, Ruby script, Perl script, Tcl script — any
text file with a `#!` first line that is exec'd via `execve`.

**Exception**: Scripts invoked by `bash script.sh` or `python3 script.py` (not exec'd directly)
are not affected since bash/python handle them without calling `execve` on the script file.

---

## Environment Variables for `run_bash.sh` Sessions

`launchdchrootexec` sets a minimal environment. Always export the following at the start of
any chroot session or script:

```bash
# Minimal working environment for the macOS chroot:
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
export HOME=/Users/root
export USER=root
export TMPDIR=/tmp
export SHELL=/bin/bash

# If you need network access (DNS goes through the SOCKS5 proxy):
export ALL_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082
export HTTPS_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082
export HTTP_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082
# Note: use socks5h:// (NOT socks5://) so DNS is resolved through the proxy too

# DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is set automatically by launchdchrootexec; do not override it.
# If a subprocess strips it (e.g. via exec env -i), re-inject:
export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/libmachook.dylib
```

**`launchdchrootexec` pre-sets**: `HOME=/Users/root`, `USER=root`, `TMPDIR=/tmp`,
`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/libmachook.dylib`.

**PATH is inherited from the iOS shell** — always set it explicitly inside scripts.

---

## AGX-Native Environment Variables (libmachook + WindowServer plist)

These are read by `libmachook` via `getenv()` at image-load time. The
production switches live in `layout/usr/macOS/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer.plist`
under `<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>`. After editing the plist, **unload + load** the
job — `launchctl kickstart -k` does NOT refresh env.

```bash
sudo launchctl unload /var/jb/usr/macOS/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer.plist
sudo launchctl load   /var/jb/usr/macOS/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer.plist
```

### Currently shipped in WindowServer plist (2026-06-19)

| Var | Value | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CA_VSYNC_OFF` | `1` | CoreAnimation skips vblank wait — required, IOMFBServer's CADisplay handoff doesn't reach chroot | always-on |
| `MACWS_AGX_NATIVE` | `1` | Master gate for AGX-native code path (vs. fallback MTLSim path). Disables the legacy `getenv("MACWS_KEEP_FORCE_ACCEL")` shim that returns the simulator MTLDevice | always-on for goal |
| `MACWS_AGX_REGISTER_CLASSES` | `1` | Walks `_dyld_image_count()` per loaded image, runs `objc_readClassPair` on every `__objc_classlist` entry. Required because Metal eager-dlopens AGXMetal13_3 before `_dyld_objc_notify_register`, so `objc_getClass("AGXBuffer") = 0x0` without this | always-on for goal |
| `MACWS_PIN_FALLBACK` | `1` | Installs the `setupCompiler`-time AGXBuffer 4-arg initFull swizzle that returns an IOSurface-backed buffer when AGXIOC sel=0x9 ResCreate fails. RE-confirmed only fires from `setupCompiler:` path; the cascade-blocker `Mempool::grow` calls `IOGPUResourceCreate` directly (no ObjC hook can intercept) | always-on for goal |

### Disabled / removed (RE- or runtime-disproved)

| Var | Why removed | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `MACWS_AGX_BORROW_CONN` | Tried to XPC-borrow `io_connect_t` from `macwsallocd` so chroot WS could reuse iOS-side-opened AGX UC | RE-disproved: `xpc_dictionary_set_mach_send(reply, "connect", conn)` followed by `xpc_connection_send_message` triggers `EXC_GUARD ILLEGAL_MOVE` on the io_connect_t mach port — IOKit guards io_connect_t at the kernel-port level, structurally cannot cross processes |
| `MACWS_AGX_FORCE_TYPE` | Override the `type` argument to `IOServiceOpen` (0/1/2 etc.) to coerce a privileged AGX user-client variant | runtime-disproved: type=0 and type=2 hang `IOServiceOpen` (no return), type=1 returns a degraded UC that still rejects sel=0x9 with `0xe00002c2`. Masking `0x100001`→`1` is the only value that doesn't hang and is kept in `IOServiceOpen_new` as the default |
| `MACWS_AGXIOC_FUZZ` | Perturb args+0x08..+0x60 by 1-byte/4-byte/8-byte deltas on sel=0x9 failure | runtime-disproved as a fix: ALL 10 perturbations across +0x08..+0x60 fail SAME code `0xe00002c2`. Kernel rejection isn't args-shape — and isn't `IOGPU+0x108` either (RE-measured 5.13 GB, see `misc/agx_iogpu_probe.c`). Real reject site still being RE'd |
| `MACWS_SUSPEND_AT_EXEC` | `SIGSTOP` self right after libmachook ctor to allow lldb attach before any ObjC class load | debug-only, never ship to plist — leaves WS frozen across respring |

### Diagnostic / opt-in (set in shell, not plist)

| Var | Effect | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `MACWS_AGX_CRASH_DIAG` | Installs a SIGSEGV handler that dumps x0–x29, sp, faulting PC, the 64 bytes around PC, and 64-byte memory at x19 + at `*(x19+0x28)`. **Critical** for AGX-native crashes where the C++ frame is mid-vector-op and lldb can't unwind | every AGX-native debug session — sole reason the Mempool::grow root cause was findable |
| `MACWS_IOSURF_TRACE` | Logs every `IOSurfaceCreate` call + size + IOSurfaceID | when chasing cross-process IOSurface bridge issues |
| `MACWS_ABORT_TRACE` | Installs a hook that prints stack frames on `abort()` / `__assert_rtn` before the program dies | tracing where assert hits came from |
| `MACWS_HID_BYPASS` | Skip the bulk hook of 15 IOHIDEventSystem* APIs (kept narrow because bulk-hooking caused silent PAC-dispatch crashes) | leave OFF in production; see [[iomfbserver-bus-adraln-fix]] |
| `MACWS_AGC_VERIFY_BYPASS` | Skip `verifyLoweredIR` in AGXCompilerCore | out-of-process MTLCompilerService runs the compile, so this is INERT in chroot — see [[agx-renamer-out-of-process-confirmed]] |
| `MACWS_AGC_FASTMATH_HOOK` | Renamer patch for `agx.air.fract.v3f16.fast` | superseded by `MTLCompilerBypassOSCheck` tweak (also out-of-process) |
| `MACWS_AGX_RENAMER_PATCH` | Alternative renamer patch entry-point | superseded — see above |
| `MACWS_AGX_OBJC_AUTDA_PATCH` | Patch libobjc `autda` → `xpacd` to survive pre-PAC-signed ObjC ivars (on-device lld arm64e fixup ABI) | runtime-confirmed needed only on certain re-signing flows; keep OFF unless diagnosing `autda` traps |
| `MACWS_AGX_SKIP_BIND_UPDATE` | NOP `MTLBindings::update_for_render_pass` BL inside AGX render-pass init (was a band-aid for setupDeferred crashes) | now implicit when `MACWS_AGX_NATIVE=1`; opt-out via `MACWS_AGX_KEEP_BIND_UPDATE=1` if testing without the skip |
| `MACWS_AGX_TEX_BYPASS_GATE` | Bypass the `validateBufferTextureWithSize:` magic-footer check (`0x99b7d4010ce3ead3 / 0x92482f97c0394fd0`) | superseded by always-on patch in `objc_hooks.c`; A/B knob |
| `MACWS_KEEP_VALIDATE_ALWAYS` | Restore the always-validate path | opposite of above — only when intentionally A/B'ing |
| `MACWS_KEEP_ASSERT_BYPASS` | Keep the blanket `__assert_rtn → log+return` patch even after fixes land | LAZY — see [[feedback-no-lazy-nop-ret-bypass]]. Only honor with explicit user instruction |
| `MACWS_KEEP_RENDER_UPDATE_CBZ` | Keep render_update CBZ-bypass | LAZY — same as above |
| `MACWS_GOT_SKIP_AUTH` | Skip authenticated-GOT slot patching during chained-fixup walker | diagnostic only — used while bootstrapping the chained-fixups walker; should be OFF in prod |
| `MACWS_GOT_RAW_AUTH` | Write raw (unsigned) pointer into auth-GOT (no `ptrauth_sign_unauthenticated`) | diagnostic only |

### Outside libmachook

| File / key | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `layout/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macwsguide.alloc.plist` `KeepAlive` | `False` | Prevents respawn loop when handler crashes — see [[ws-crash-loop-stop-immediately]] |
| `layout/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macwsguide.alloc.plist` `ThrottleInterval` | `60` | Lower bound on respawn cadence even if launchd-side flag flips |
| `layout/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macwsguide.alloc.plist` `RunAtLoad` | `True` | macwsallocd should be up before WS so the XPC service answer for `borrow-agx-conn` / `alloc-iosurf` is already listening |

### How to verify a var is active in the running WS

```bash
# Find WS PID (chroot binary, NOT iOS WindowServer if any):
PID=$(pgrep -f WindowServer | xargs -I{} sh -c 'ps -p {} -o command= | grep -q chroot && echo {}')

# Dump its env (kernel-stored; sudo required for foreign-user proc):
sudo ps -E -p "$PID" | tr ' ' '\n' | grep MACWS_
```

If a var is missing, the plist edit did not take effect (likely `launchctl
unload + load` was skipped, or the file inside the deb is being shadowed).

## Skills: Common Operations

### Skill: Sign and Trustcache a Single Binary

```bash
# On iOS shell (run_bash NOT needed — this is iOS-side ldid):
ENT=/var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/entitlements.plist
BIN=/var/mnt/rootfs/path/to/binary
sudo ldid -S"$ENT" -M "$BIN"
for arch in arm64 arm64e x86_64; do
    h=$(ldid -arch "$arch" -h "$BIN" 2>/dev/null | grep CDHash= | cut -c8-)
    [ -n "$h" ] && sudo /var/jb/usr/bin/jbctl trustcache add "$h" && echo "Trusted [$arch]: $h"
done
```

### Skill: Sign All Mach-O Files in a Directory Tree

Use `misc/sign_installed.sh` (deployed to `/var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/sign_installed.sh`).
This is the standard tool for signing after any `port install`, `brew install`, or `pip install`.

```bash
# Sign everything MacPorts installed (most common case after port install):
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/sign_installed.sh macports

# Sign everything Homebrew installed:
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/sign_installed.sh homebrew

# Sign both (default):
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/sign_installed.sh

# Sign an arbitrary directory (e.g. after extracting a tarball):
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/sign_installed.sh /var/mnt/rootfs/usr/local/myapp

# After pip install — sign new .so files in Python site-packages:
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/sign_installed.sh \
  /var/mnt/rootfs/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages
```

The script is idempotent and safe to re-run at any time. It skips non-Mach-O files silently.

### Skill: Run a Multi-Line Script in the Chroot (Non-Interactive)

Place the script in the rootfs so it is accessible inside the chroot:
```bash
# Write script to rootfs (accessible inside chroot as /tmp/myscript.sh)
cat > /var/mnt/rootfs/tmp/myscript.sh << 'EOF'
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
export ALL_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082
# ... script body ...
EOF

# Run it (no shebang needed — bash -s reads from stdin or bash <path> executes directly):
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh /tmp/myscript.sh
```

Or pipe inline via stdin (script stays on iOS filesystem):
```bash
echo 'alpine' | sudo -S bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh -s << 'EOF'
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
echo "hello from chroot"
EOF
```

### Skill: Strip Shebangs from a Directory of Scripts (iOS Side)

```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
import os, sys

target_dir = "/var/mnt/rootfs/opt/homebrew/Library/Homebrew/shims"
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(target_dir):
    for fname in files:
        fpath = os.path.join(root, fname)
        try:
            with open(fpath, 'r+', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
                content = f.read()
                if content.startswith('#!'):
                    newline_pos = content.find('\n')
                    if newline_pos != -1:
                        f.seek(0)
                        f.write(content[newline_pos+1:])
                        f.truncate()
                        print(f"Stripped shebang: {fpath}")
        except (IsADirectoryError, PermissionError):
            pass
EOF
```

### Skill: Check If a CDHash Is in the Trustcache

```bash
cdhash=$(ldid -arch arm64 -h /var/mnt/rootfs/path/to/binary 2>/dev/null | grep CDHash= | cut -c8-)
echo "CDHash: $cdhash"
jbctl trustcache info | grep -i "$cdhash" && echo "IN trustcache" || echo "NOT in trustcache"
```

**Note**: Use `jbctl trustcache info` to dump the trustcache contents. `jbctl trustcache list`
always returns empty output and does not work for checking trustcache membership.

### Skill: Debug Why a Binary Is Being Killed

```bash
# Watch AMFI/kernel logs while running the binary in another session:
sudo dmesg | grep -E 'AMFI|deny|kill|sigkill' | tail -20
# Or:
sudo oslog | grep "AMFI\|violation\|kill"
```

### Skill: Install MacPorts Package (After Base is Set Up)

```bash
# Inside chroot, with proxy set:
export ALL_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
port install <package>

# After install, sign all new Mach-O files (run from iOS shell, NOT inside chroot):
# (use the bulk-sign skill above, targeting /var/mnt/rootfs/opt/local)
```

---

## Package Manager Notes

- **MacPorts** (`/opt/local`): Works. Has prebuilt binaries for macOS 13 arm64. `port` binary
  is a Mach-O (no shebang issue). After each `port install`, re-sign all new Mach-O files.
  See `docs/macports-notes.md` for full details.

- **Homebrew** (`/opt/homebrew`): Does NOT work for package installation on macOS 13 arm64 —
  no bottles available, source builds require Xcode CLT (AMFI-killed). `brew --version` can
  be made to work but `brew install` fails. See `docs/homebrew-notes.md` for full details.

---

## Python 3.13 (MacPorts)

Installed as `port install python313`. Confirmed working as of 2026-03-15 (version 3.13.12).

### Required: sign all Mach-O files after install

Run `/tmp/sign_python313.sh` (iOS side) or the bulk-sign skill from CLAUDE.md targeting
`/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13` and `/opt/local/lib`.

### pip setup

```bash
# Install pip (bundled with Python 3.13):
python3.13 -m ensurepip --upgrade

# pip needs PySocks to use a SOCKS5 proxy. Bootstrap it via curl:
curl -sL --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082 --cacert /etc/ssl/cert.pem \
  "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a2/4b/52123768624ae28d84c97515dd96c9958888e8c2d8f122074e31e2be878c/PySocks-1.7.1-py27-none-any.whl" \
  -o /tmp/PySocks-1.7.1-py3-none-any.whl
python3.13 -m pip install --no-deps /tmp/PySocks-1.7.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Required environment variables for Python sessions

```bash
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/cert.pem           # macOS cert bundle (Security fw unreachable in chroot)
export ALL_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082        # DNS-aware SOCKS5 proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082
# Include the Python framework bin for pip3/pip3.13 commands:
export PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin:$PATH
```

### After every `pip install` — sign new .so files (from iOS shell)

```bash
ENT=/var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/entitlements.plist
SITE=/var/mnt/rootfs/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages
find "$SITE" -type f \( -name "*.so" -o -name "*.dylib" \) | while read f; do
    sudo ldid -S"$ENT" -M "$f" 2>/dev/null
    h=$(ldid -arch arm64 -h "$f" 2>/dev/null | grep CDHash= | cut -c8-)
    [ -n "$h" ] && sudo /var/jb/usr/bin/jbctl trustcache add "$h" && echo "signed: $(basename $f)"
done
```

### Confirmed working modules

`sys`, `os`, `json`, `re`, `math`, `hashlib`, `sqlite3`, `ssl`, `zlib`, `lzma`, `bz2`, `csv`,
`ctypes`, `decimal`, `readline`, `multiprocessing`, `concurrent.futures`,
`requests` (pip), `charset_normalizer` (pip), `certifi` (pip), `urllib3` (pip)

## Debugging Techniques

### Skill: Reproduce the Basic Sanity Test

```bash
# Quick smoke test — must exit 0 and print "hi":
ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.5.8 \
  'sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh -c "echo hi" 2>&1; echo "exit: $?"'
# "chdir: No such file or directory" on stderr is harmless (falls back to /).
# Any non-zero exit or SIGTRAP means libmachook is broken.
```

### Skill: Read Crash Reports (iOS CrashReporter)

macOS binaries running inside the chroot are reported by iOS CrashReporter:

```bash
# List recent bash crashes:
ls -t /private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/bash*.ips | head -5

# Key fields to extract from a .ips crash report (JSON format):
#   exception.type        — EXC_BREAKPOINT = PAC trap or __builtin_trap
#   exception.signal      — SIGTRAP = Trace/BPT trap
#   threads[].threadState.esr.description — "(Breakpoint) pointer authentication trap DA"
#   threads[].frames[].symbol — call stack symbols
#   usedImages[].path     — loaded images at crash time

# Quick parse (procursus python3, NOT inside chroot):
python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.loads(open(sys.argv[1]).readlines()[1])   # skip first line (metadata)
print('Exception:', data['exception'])
print('ESR:', data['threads'][0]['threadState'].get('esr', {}))
for f in data['threads'][0]['frames'][:10]:
    print(' ', f.get('symbol','?'), '+', f.get('symbolLocation',0))
" /private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/bash-XXXX.ips
```

**Common crash signatures:**

| Signal | ESR description | Cause |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| SIGTRAP / EXC_BREAKPOINT | pointer authentication trap DA | `autda` on unsigned or wrongly-signed pointer — ObjC class data PAC mismatch |
| SIGTRAP / EXC_BREAKPOINT | (none / BRK) | `abort()`, ObjC uncaught exception, `__builtin_trap()` |
| SIGKILL (exit 137) | — | AMFI denial or sandbox violation |

### Skill: Inspect Mach-O Fixup Format

```python
# Check LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY vs LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS for each slice:
python3 - /path/to/binary <<'EOF'
import struct, sys
data = open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()
LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY=0x80000022; LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS=0x80000034
nfat = struct.unpack_from('>I', data, 4)[0]
for i in range(nfat):
    ct,cs,off,sz,_ = struct.unpack_from('>IIIII', data, 8+i*20)
    name = {(0x0100000c,0):'arm64',(0x0100000c,2):'arm64e'}.get((ct,cs&0xFF),'?')
    hdr = struct.unpack_from('<IIIIIIII', data, off)
    cmd_off = off + 32
    for _ in range(hdr[4]):
        cmd,sz2 = struct.unpack_from('<II', data, cmd_off)
        if cmd==LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS: print(f'{name}: LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS')
        if cmd==LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY:      print(f'{name}: LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY')
        cmd_off += sz2
EOF
```

**arm64e + LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY**: lld on-device stores ObjC `class_t->data` as a
PAC-pre-signed value (iOS keys).  macOS libobjc's `autda` fails → PAC trap.

**arm64e + LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS** (what `-Wl,-fixup_chains` gives): lld stores
`class_t->data` as a plain non-auth rebase.  macOS libobjc's `autda` still fails
on an unsigned pointer.  **Workaround**: guard ObjC class definitions with
`#ifndef __arm64e__` so no `class_t` entries exist in the arm64e slice.

### Skill: Attach lldb to a Stuck macOS Process

macOS binaries that hang (waiting for XPC / WindowServer / Metal init) can be
debugged by attaching iOS lldb from the iOS shell:

```bash
# 1. Launch the process in background from a chroot session:
sudo bash /var/jb/usr/macOS/bin/run_bash.sh -c \
  "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin; /path/to/MacOS/Binary &" &

# 2. Find its PID (it is a macOS arm64e process):
sleep 2 && pgrep -n Binary

# 3. Attach lldb (iOS-side lldb at /var/jb/usr/bin/lldb):
sudo /var/jb/usr/bin/lldb -p <PID>

# 4. Inside lldb — get all thread backtraces to find what's blocking:
(lldb) thread backtrace all
(lldb) process interrupt     # pause if running
(lldb) bt all                # same as thread backtrace all
```

Key lldb commands for diagnosing hangs:
- `thread list` — list all threads and their current state
- `thread backtrace all` — full stack for every thread
- `frame info` — details about current frame
- `p (char*)dlerror()` — check last dyld/dl error
- `image list` — all loaded images (check if Metal/libmachook loaded)
- `process detach` — detach without killing

### Known arm64e libmachook Issues (on-device lld)

| Problem | Root cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| PAC trap in `readClass` on `MTLFakeDevice` | on-device lld emits plain non-auth chained fixup for `class_t->data`; macOS libobjc does `autda` → trap | Guard `MTLFakeDevice` with `#ifndef __arm64e__` in `Metal_hooks.x` |
| Arm64-only dylib rejected | macOS arm64e dyld rejects DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES dylib without arm64e slice | Keep `ARCHS = arm64 arm64e` in `libmachook/Makefile` |
| arm64e chroot process SIGKILL'd at load (`KILL - CODESIGNING / Invalid Page`); backtrace `dyld4::...forEachInsertedDylib → mapFileReadOnly → hasMachOMagic()`; arm64 unaffected | **`cp -f` over the rootfs libmachook reuses the SAME inode** → the chroot kernel's cached code-signature blob for that vnode goes stale, so the new file's pages validate against the OLD hashes → AMFI Invalid Page. File/sig/trustcache all look correct (page hashes are self-consistent); the kernel just isn't using this blob. arm64 escapes only because WindowServer stays mapped from one clean load. Spans reboots (every rebuild re-`cp -f`'s in place). | **`rm -f` the dest before `cp`** so the refreshed dylib gets a NEW inode (no stale cached blob). Done in `layout/usr/macOS/bin/postinst.sh`. Verified: rm+cp → `run_bash.sh -c "echo hi"` → exit 0. |

**Note:** `jbctl trustcache info` REQUIRES root on this build (despite the "no sudo" note earlier in this file) — without sudo it errors out, and grepping its (empty) output yields false "not trusted" results.

## On-Device Debug Workflows

### Skill: USB SSH via `iproxy` (port 22222 → device 22)

WiFi SSH (`ssh -p 2222 root@192.168.5.8`) is the comfortable path but fails
when the device WiFi flaps under heavy iOS load (high load average kills WiFi
keepalive). USB SSH stays up regardless of CPU pressure.

```bash
# On macOS host, start iproxy in a background-friendly mode:
brew install libimobiledevice   # provides `iproxy`
iproxy 22222 22 &               # forwards localhost:22222 → device:22

# Then SSH stays on localhost — survives WiFi outages:
ssh -p 22222 root@127.0.0.1
```

Add to `~/.ssh/config` for convenience:
```
Host ipad-usb
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    Port 22222
    User root
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```

Then: `ssh ipad-usb 'uptime'`.

**Practical rule**: any session involving lldb (long-lived TCP), `oslog -f`
streaming, or repeated builds — use USB SSH. The cost of a dropped TCP is
re-attaching lldb from scratch, which loses all breakpoint state.

### Skill: lldb on iOS via tmux (`misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh`)

The iOS Procursus lldb has **no python scripting**, **no expression evaluator**,
and `lldb-server` crashes on attach. Only `debugserver` works on the iOS side
for remote lldb-from-mac, but that path needs every breakpoint round-trip to
ping the dyld shared cache on the host (slow). For interactive RE we use
**iOS-local lldb driven via tmux** — symbol lookups stay on-device and we
never restart the lldb session.

```bash
# Attach (creates a persistent tmux session named "ioslldb"):
bash misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh attach 127.0.0.1 22222 WindowServer

# Send one lldb command and read the reply:
bash misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh cmd 'register read x0 x21'
bash misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh cmd 'br set -n IOConnectCallMethod -c "$x1 == 0xa"'
bash misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh cmd 'continue'

# Multi-line (use only -o per BP — iOS lldb has no script):
bash misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh cmd-multi <<'EOF'
breakpoint command add 1
register read x0 x1 x2 x3
continue
DONE
EOF

# Dump latest pane output:
bash misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh capture 400

# Detach + kill session cleanly:
bash misc/ios_lldb_tmux.sh stop
```

**Quirks discovered (runtime-verified):**

| Quirk | Workaround |
|---|---|
| `br set -n foo -c "selector == 10"` fails — iOS lldb cannot parse arg names | Use registers: `br set -n IOConnectCallMethod -c '$x1 == 0xa'` |
| `memory read --size 8 --count 8` chooses default format incorrectly under some lldb builds → garbled output | Always pass `--format x` explicitly |
| `script` / `script-language` / `expression` all unavailable | Pre-compute the value on host, paste literal. For loops, use `br command add -o cmd1 -o cmd2 -o continue` (single `-o` per line) |
| tmux under sudo errors `LC_CTYPE: cannot set locale` and `/tmp/tmux-501` permission denied | Wrap: `sudo env LC_CTYPE=UTF-8 TMUX_TMPDIR=/var/tmp tmux ...` |
| Attaching to a process that already has TXs state can hang the attach | `process detach` from any prior lldb first; if no lldb, `kill -CONT $PID` then re-attach |
| `image list` returns the chroot image set — NOT iOS dyld_cache. Symbols there map to chroot paths | Cross-binary lookups must run separately against `~/Downloads/agx-re/` slid binaries with capstone |

**`MACWS_SUSPEND_AT_EXEC=1` pattern** for early-startup RE: makes libmachook
`raise(SIGSTOP)` in its `__attribute__((constructor))` so the process is
frozen BEFORE any framework init. Then attach iOS lldb, set breakpoints in
AGXMetal13_3 / SkyLight / IOSurface, then `process signal SIGCONT`. Without
this, the crash happens during one of the deep-load initializers and lldb
catches it after the fact.

```bash
# In WS plist EnvironmentVariables (TEMPORARY — never ship):
<key>MACWS_SUSPEND_AT_EXEC</key>
<string>1</string>
```

### Skill: `FAST=1 bash build_on_ios.sh` — what it skips, what trips it

`build_on_ios.sh` defaults to a full clean build (~20s on iPad13,6). Add
`FAST=1` (or `--fast`) and it skips `make clean` + skips `make package` +
just `cp`s the rebuilt `libmachook.{arm64,arm64e}.dylib` to
`/var/mnt/rootfs/usr/local/lib/` and runs the libmachook-only postinst step.
Cuts to ~3s.

**The guardrail (auto-fallback to full)**:
```
FAST=1 → check mtime of MTLCompilerBypassOSCheck / launchdchrootexec /
        autosignd / MTLSimDriverHost / launchservicesd / mountdevfs /
        Makefile / control / layout against /var/jb/usr/lib/TweakInject/
        MTLCompilerBypassOSCheck.dylib — if ANY source newer → FAST=0
```

This is critical: `FAST` only ships libmachook. Any edit to:
- `MTLCompilerBypassOSCheck/Tweak.x` — out-of-process Substrate tweak hooks won't refresh
- `launchdchrootexec/*` — chroot loader won't refresh
- `autosignd/*` — re-sign daemon won't refresh
- `MTLSimDriverHost/*` — XPC host won't refresh
- `layout/usr/macOS/LaunchDaemons/*.plist` — env vars and ProgramArgs won't refresh
- `layout/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.macwsguide.*.plist` — iOS-side daemons won't refresh
- `layout/usr/macOS/bin/*.sh` — helper scripts won't refresh

... requires the full path (deb build + `dpkg -i`). The guardrail forces it.

**Common FAST trip case**:
```
==> FAST guardrail tripped: source files newer than last dpkg-installed tweak:
      layout/usr/macOS/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer.plist
==> Forcing full build (FAST only ships libmachook; deb-installed bits would stay stale)
```
This is correct behavior — you edited the plist; `cp libmachook` would have
hidden the change.

**Pitfall — `git stash` + `git checkout -- file` interaction**: stash only
saves PRE-stash uncommitted changes. If you `git stash`, then
`git checkout commit -- some_file`, that creates a NEW modification not in
the stash. `git stash pop` will NOT restore the original. Always
`git status` after stash operations.

**Pitfall — running `build_on_ios.sh` without `THEOS`**: SSH does not
inherit `THEOS` from the device's interactive shell. Always:
```bash
ssh -p 22222 root@127.0.0.1 \
  'THEOS=/var/jb/var/mobile/theos bash /var/jb/var/mobile/MacWSBootingGuide/misc/build_on_ios.sh'
```
without that prefix you'll see `Theos not found` and the build silently
falls back to system make rules.

**Pitfall — `cp -f` over rootfs libmachook reuses the same inode** — already
fixed in `layout/usr/macOS/bin/postinst.sh` (it `rm -f`s the dest first),
but if you write a side-channel that bypasses postinst (e.g. `scp` directly
to `/var/mnt/rootfs/usr/local/lib/libmachook.dylib`) you'll hit the AMFI
Invalid Page bug. See the Known arm64e Issues table above.

### Skill: AGXIOC selector argument FUZZ (`MACWS_AGXIOC_FUZZ=1`)

When kernel rejects an `IOConnectCallMethod` with a structurally-correct
error code (`0xe00002c2 = kIOReturnNotPermitted`), the question is whether
the rejection is **input-shape** (some args field is invalid for this
selector) or **structural** (the UC doesn't have permission regardless of
input).

The fuzz path in `mac_hooks.m` perturbs args at +0x08, +0x10, +0x18, ...,
+0x60 by 1-byte / 4-byte / 8-byte deltas around the failing call and re-runs
each variant. The expected outcomes:

| Result | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| One or two perturbations succeed (return 0) | Input-shape — narrow on which field controls the gate |
| **ALL** perturbations fail same error code | Structural — kernel doesn't look at args. (Previously attributed to `device->0x108==0` per-UC field — DISPROVEN; see `misc/agx_iogpu_probe.c` measurement of `+0x108 = 5.13 GB`.) Real reject site still being RE'd |
| Some perturbations cause `IOServiceClose`-on-error | The kernel is doing input validation, fuzz has triggered a different validation path |

**RE-confirmed for sel=0x9 ResCreate**: all 10 perturbations fail `0xe00002c2`.
Conclusion: structural — see [[agx-direct-path-all-three-paths-blocked]].

### Skill: One-shot hex dump for large opaque struct inputs

When an external method takes a 1032-byte `inputStruct` (sel=0x7/0x8 args)
and we don't know the layout, dump it ONCE per (PID, selector) tuple:

```c
/* In IOConnectCallMethod_new, after the failing call: */
static dispatch_once_t dumped[16];
if (selector < 16) {
    dispatch_once(&dumped[selector], ^{
        /* Head: first 256 bytes, hex+ascii */
        fprintf(stderr, "#### sel=%llu inputStructCnt=%zu head256:\n", selector, inputStructCnt);
        hex_dump_chunk((const char *)inputStruct, MIN(inputStructCnt, 256));
        /* Tail: scan past 256 for non-zero u64s */
        const uint64_t *u = (const uint64_t *)inputStruct;
        size_t cnt = inputStructCnt / 8;
        for (size_t i = 32; i < cnt; ++i) {
            if (u[i]) fprintf(stderr, "    +%#zx: %#llx\n", i * 8, u[i]);
        }
    });
}
```

The "head + non-zero scan" pattern beats raw `xxd` because the typical iOS
AGX inputStruct is `512 zero, qos@0x400, 504 more zero` — the head shows
the live fields, the scan catches the late qos slot without spamming.

### Skill: Cross-binary RE with capstone for arm64e kexts

`otool -tV /System/Library/Extensions/AGXKextG13.kext/...` fails on arm64e
kext bundles — the disassembler doesn't decode PAC-flavored auth-call
opcodes. Use macholib + capstone instead:

```python
import macholib.MachO, capstone
m = macholib.MachO.MachO('/path/to/AGXKextG13')
hdr = m.headers[0]
slide = next(s.vmaddr for c, _, s in hdr.commands if hasattr(s, 'segname') and s.segname == b'__TEXT')
text  = next(c for c, _, _ in hdr.commands if hasattr(c, 'segname') and c.segname == b'__TEXT')
# capstone CS_MODE_ARM disasm
cs = capstone.Cs(capstone.CS_ARCH_ARM64, capstone.CS_MODE_ARM)
cs.detail = True
data = open('/path/to/AGXKextG13', 'rb').read()
# disasm function at unslid 0xfffffe0009f03b4c → file offset
off = 0xfffffe0009f03b4c - slide + text.fileoff
for ins in cs.disasm(data[off:off+0x400], 0xfffffe0009f03b4c):
    print(f"{ins.address:#x}  {ins.mnemonic:6s}  {ins.op_str}")
```

This is the only way to read `IOGPUDevice::new_resource +0xff` (the source
of the `0xe00002c2` rejection) — BN MCP works too but the macholib+capstone
loop fits inline into our usual evidence-discipline workflow.

### Skill: Read AGX-native crash report stack with mid-vector PCs

AGX-native crashes typically die mid-vector-op (PC inside a 256-byte
`memmove` / `__bzero` / `memcpy` slot) and lldb cannot unwind across the
fault. The `MACWS_AGX_CRASH_DIAG` SIGSEGV handler dumps register + memory
snapshot — combine with the `.ips` crash report's framepointers:

```bash
# 1. Find the latest WindowServer crash:
ls -t /private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/WindowServer-*.ips | head -1

# 2. Parse exception PC + key frames:
python3 - "$1" <<'EOF'
import json, sys
data = json.loads(open(sys.argv[1]).readlines()[1])
print('exception:', data['exception'])
print('threadState x19=', hex(data['threads'][0]['threadState']['x'][19]['value']))
print('threadState x0=',  hex(data['threads'][0]['threadState']['x'][0]['value']))
print('pc=',              hex(data['threads'][0]['threadState']['pc']['value']))
print('faulting frames:')
for f in data['threads'][0]['frames'][:8]:
    print(f"  {f.get('imageIndex','?'):3} +{f.get('imageOffset','?'):#x}  {f.get('symbol','?')}")
print('images:')
for f in data['threads'][0]['frames'][:8]:
    idx = f.get('imageIndex')
    if idx is None: continue
    img = data['usedImages'][idx]
    print(f"  {idx:3}  base={img['base']:#x}  {img['name']}")
EOF

# 3. With the chosen image's `base` and frame offset, look up the macOS
#    AGXMetal13_3 (in ~/Downloads/agx-re/) symbol at base+offset using BN
#    or capstone+addr2line.
```

The `MACWS_AGX_CRASH_DIAG` log line and the `.ips` exception are
**redundant by design** — if one is missing or corrupted (oslog buffer
overflow, crashreporter race), the other is usually intact.
